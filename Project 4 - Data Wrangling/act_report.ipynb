    "In this report I'm going to share some insights on the dataset `Twitter Data WeRateDogs`. This dataset consists of about 2000 tweets posted on Twitter between end of 2015 and mid of 2017. The Twitter channel [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates?lang=en) provides dog pictures with funny comments and ratings on a regular basis.\n",
    "For creating this insights I was merging and analyzing data from three different sources:\n",
    "* a Twitter archive of tweets provides as csv.file from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)\n",
    "* Twitter tweet data gathered via [Twitter's API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)\n",
    "* a dataset of image prediction data provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)  \n",
